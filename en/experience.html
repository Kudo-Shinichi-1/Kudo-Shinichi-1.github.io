		<p>This thesis explores unreliable narration in S.J. Watson's contemporary psychological thriller novel <i>Before I Go to Sleep</i>. The study aims to investigate the characteristics of unreliable narration in the novel and its unique role in revealing themes and enhancing suspense, unveiling the complex layers of unreliable narration not fully explored in previous studies. Through detailed textual analysis and rhetorical methods, the study identifies three main narrative features and further analyzes the manifestation of unreliability using Phelan's three-axial theory, innovatively proposing six dynamic relationships between these axes, deepening our understanding of narrative complexity. By introducing "high-level" mathematical concepts into literary analysis, the study explores the concept of "higher-order unreliability," highlighting the transmissibility and multidimensionality of unreliability in narration, revealing intertwined themes of loss and awakening, memory and identity, as well as metaphorical expressions of modern life.</p>
