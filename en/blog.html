				<b> <a href="../blog/scholar_抽象动词.pdf" target="_blank"> Exploring the Impact of Kinesthetic Experiences and Spatial Metaphors in Teaching Practice on Second Grade Students' Comprehension of Abstract Verbs</a> (On Children's Language Acquisition) </b> <br>
				This is a long article that explores the effectiveness of two cognitive theories—embodied cognition theory and conceptual metaphor theory—when teaching abstract verbs. By incorporating kinesthetic experiences and spatial metaphors into teaching, it evaluates how these innovative methods impact second-grade students' understanding of abstract verbs, aiming to improve language learning outcomes and promote children's language and cognitive development.

				Children learn concrete language expressions by imitating the language they hear around them and then use their general cognitive and social cognitive skills to categorize, generalize, and creatively combine these expressions and structures. Where does grammatical structure come from? In general, we can assume that human language ultimately originated from a species-specific biological adaptation for symbolic communication, but the actual grammatical structures of modern language were created by humans through grammaticalization processes in specific cultural histories, as well as through cultural learning, schema formation, and structural combination in individual development.

				Discussing the standardization process of Chinese sign language and the challenges it faces, analyzing the differences between natural sign language and sign Chinese, as well as the application challenges in deaf education. Although sign language has made some progress in standardization, there are still linguistic differences in practical teaching. It is recommended that future education focus more on the needs of deaf students and promote the balanced development of natural sign language and sign Chinese.

				By analyzing "bad guy" characters in literary works, such as Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice," Professor Moriarty in "Sherlock Holmes," and Judge Wargrave in "And Then There Were None," this article explores the multifaceted humanity behind these characters. I argue that everyone may possess both good and bad traits. The round characters in literary works showcase this complexity, revealing the intricate nature of human personalities and motivations, and reminding us to approach others with tolerance and understanding.

				<b> <a href="../blog/scholar_基于实践和思辨的内源性道德教育.pdf" target="_blank"> Exogenous Moral Education Based on Practice and Reflection </a> (About Class Teachers and Moral Education) </b> <br>
				Moral education is an important component of school education. While the development of moral education in schools is steadily advancing, moral deficiencies still exist in the results, and the national moral standards still need improvement. There are also areas of moral education that are being neglected. Implementing exogenous moral education based on practice and reflection aims to focus on helping students construct correct moral views through independent practice and reflection, breaking free from rigid theoretical knowledge, and enabling students to internally align with universally accepted social moral standards.
