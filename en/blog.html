				<b> <a href="../blog/scholar_抽象动词.pdf" target="_blank"> Exploring the Impact of Kinesthetic Experiences and Spatial Metaphors in Teaching Practice on Second Grade Students' Comprehension of Abstract Verbs</a> (About children's language acquisition) </b> <br>
				A long article exploring the effectiveness of two cognitive theories — embodied cognition theory and conceptual metaphor theory — in teaching abstract verbs. By integrating kinesthetic experiences and spatial metaphors into teaching, the study evaluates the impact of these innovative teaching methods on second-grade students' understanding of abstract verbs, aiming to improve language learning outcomes and promote children's language and cognitive development.

				<b>Report: The item-based nature of children's early syntactic development - <a href="../blog/scholar_Tomasello.pdf" target="_blank"> Slides</a> | <a href="../blog/scholar_Tomasello_handout.pdf" target="_blank"> Handouts</a> (About children's language acquisition) </b> <br>
				This report introduces Tomasello's theory of child language acquisition. Children learn concrete linguistic expressions from the language they hear around them through imitation, and then use their general cognitive and social cognitive skills to categorize, generalize, and creatively combine these individually learned expressions and structures. Where do grammatical structures come from? — In general, we can hypothesize that human language ultimately originated from a species-specific biological adaptation for symbolic communication, but the actual grammatical structure of modern languages was created by humans through specific cultural historical grammaticalization processes, as well as through cultural learning, schema formation, and structural combination in individual development.

				This article compares Hans Christian Andersen's <i>The Emperor's New Clothes</i> and Italo Calvino's <i>The Happy Man's Shirt</i>, focusing on how they use clothing as a symbolic medium to convey themes of power, desire, materialism, oppression by the ruling class, and resistance by new forces.

Despite some achievements in standardization, language differences persist in practical teaching, and it is recommended that future education pay more attention to the needs of deaf students, promoting the balanced development of natural sign language and sign Chinese.

				<b> <a href="../blog/scholar_英国文学1.pdf" target="_blank"> The Narration in <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> </a> (About British literature) </b> <br>

				<b> <a href="../blog/scholar_英国文学2.pdf" target="_blank"> Behind the “bad guys” </a> (About British literature) </b> <br>
				By analyzing the "bad guy" characters in several literary works, such as Shylock in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, Professor Moriarty in <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, and Judge Wargrave in <i>And Then There Were None</i>, this piece explores the multidimensional humanity behind these "villains". I believe that everyone can embody both good and bad traits, and the round characters in literature demonstrate this point, revealing the complexity of human personality and behavioral motives. It reminds us to maintain tolerance and understanding when judging others.

				<b> <a href="../blog/scholar_基于实践和思辨的内源性道德教育.pdf" target="_blank"> Practice and Reflection-Based Indigenous Moral Education </a> (About class teacher and moral education work) </b> <br>
				Moral education is an important part of school education. Although moral education construction in schools is progressing steadily, the results still reveal a lack of morality, and the national moral level still needs improvement. There are still neglected aspects of moral education in schools. Conducting practice and reflection-based indigenous moral education focuses on allowing students to construct a correct moral outlook through autonomous practice and reflection, breaking the constraints of rigid theoretical knowledge, enabling the educated to achieve a high internal recognition of the common moral standards of society.
